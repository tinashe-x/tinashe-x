## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate full-stack JavaScript developer with hands-on experience in building web and mobile apps. I specialize in React, Next.js, and Node.js, and I’ve contributed to products deployed on platforms like Google Play. I enjoy collaborating with teams, building scalable APIs, and constantly sharpening my dev and QA skills.

> Outside of coding, I love gaming, listening to music, and playing football whenever I can!
